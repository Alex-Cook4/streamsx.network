It includes operators and functions that can:\r\n\r\n- ingest raw ethernet packets from live network interfaces and recordings of network traffic\r\n\r\n- parse DHCP, DNS, Netflow, and IPFIX messages\r\n\r\n- reassemble application-level files from network packets\r\n\r\n- map IP addresses into city, state, and country locations\r\n\r\n- convert IP addresses betweeen binary and string representations\r\n\r\nThis version of the toolkit is intended for use with IBM Streams release 4.1 and later.\r\n\r\nFor the toolkit's documentation, please see [http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.network/doc/spldoc/html/](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.network/doc/spldoc/html/).\r\n\r\nFor the toolkit's source code, please see [https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.network/](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.network/).\r\n",
