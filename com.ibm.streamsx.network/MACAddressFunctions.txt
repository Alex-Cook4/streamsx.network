Network Toolkit: MAC Address functions
--------------------------------------


_____Description_____


The InfoSphere Streams network toolkit includes functions that transform
ethernet MAC addresses between string and six-byte binary presentations.  

The toolkit includes these MAC address functions:

    rstring convertMACAddressNumericToString(list<uint8>[6] macAddressNumeric)

    list<uint8>[6] convertMACAddressStringToNumeric(rstring macAddressString)

The functions use these representations of ethernet MAC addresses:

  * The six-byte binary representation of a MAC address is an SPL list
    of six unsigned eight-bit integers (that is, a 'list<unit8>[6]' type), with
    bytes in network order.  For example, [ 152, 90, 235, 203, 55, 219 ].

  * The string representation of a MAC address is passed as an SPL string (that
    is, an 'rstring' type) of hexadecimal characters separated by colons. For
    example, '98:5a:eb:cb:37:db'.

The MAC address functions are part of the network toolkit. To use them in an
application, include this statement in the SPL source file:

    use com.ibm.streamsx.network.mac::*;

The network toolkit includes several sample applications that illustrate how to
use the functions.

Notes:

  * If a string argument passed to convertMACAddressStringToNumeric() does not
    contain a valid ethernet MAC address, a list of six zeroes is returned.
