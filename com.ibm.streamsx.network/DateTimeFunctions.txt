Network Toolkit: date&time formatting functions
-----------------------------------------------


_____Description_____


The InfoSphere Streams network toolkit includes functions that format numeric
date&time values as string representations.

The toolkit includes these functions that format 'Unix epoch' values (that is,
seconds since midnight on January 1st, 1970 in Greenwich, England) as strings of
the form "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.UUUUUU" (where the precision of the subsecond
portion defaults to '6' if not specified) in the local time zone (for example,
"2015-09-23 10:51:50.738094" or "2015-09-23 10:51:50.738"):

    rstring formatEpochDateTime(uint32 seconds)

    rstring formatEpochDateTime(float64 seconds, uint32 precision)
    rstring formatEpochDateTime(float64 seconds)

    rstring formatEpochDateTime(timestamp seconds, uint32 precision)
    rstring formatEpochDateTime(timestamp seconds)

The toolkit also includes these functions that format 'Unix epoch' values as
strings of the form "HHH:MM:SS.UUUUUU" (where the precision of the subsecond
portion defaults to '6' if not specified) in the local time zone (for example,
"10:51:50.738094" or "10:51:50.738"):

    rstring formatEpochTime(uint32 seconds)

    rstring formatEpochTime(float64 seconds, uint32 precision)
    rstring formatEpochTime(float64 seconds)

    rstring formatEpochTime(timestamp seconds, uint32 precision)
    rstring formatEpochTime(timestamp seconds)

The toolkit also includes these functions that format 'elasped time' values
(that is, seconds since some arbitrary point in time) as strings of the form
"DDDDd HHh MMm SS.UUUUUUs" (where the precision of the subsecond portion
defaults to '6' if not specified), with leading zeros omitted (for example,
"11h 59m 8s" or "2.128s"):

    rstring formatElapsedTime(float64 seconds, uint32 precision)
    rstring formatElapsedTime(float64 seconds)

The date&time formatting functions are part of the network toolkit. To use them
in an application, include this statement in the SPL source file:

    use com.ibm.streamsx.network.parse::*;

The network toolkit includes several sample applications that illustrate how to
use the functions.

Notes:

  * A 'float64 seconds' argument may have a meaningful precision of
    microseconds, if it is set from a source that provides that resolution.

  * A 'timestamp seconds' argument may have a meaningful precision of
    nanoseconds, if it is set from a source that provides that resolution.

  * A 'uint32 seconds' argument may have a meaningless value after January 18th,
    2038, if it is set from a source that uses an 'int32' type. See
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem for detals.
